# dev_community
a site for maintaining coding related activities 

A Rough Outline to work on this:

1. Fork this repository into your own repo using the button on the top right hand side.

2. Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/"your github account name"/dev_community.git

3. You can create a new branch using "git checkout - b (your branch name)" if you want to work on a different branch to master.

4. The site is based on Hugo , using Rstudio might help , otherwise the command-line terminal could be sufficient.

5. After making changes you can add/commit and push onto the branch you are working on. (There are many great tutorials for doing this online).

6. You can submit a pull request or ping if want some help .
